# pygist queries public gists, one user at a time :)
#
# Syntax: # get_gist <username>
#
# Where <username> is a valid GitHub username.
#
# The first time you query a user the script will display all gists
# for that user. A user file will be created in the same working directory
# named "./pygist.<username>". Subsequent executions for the same username 
# will only show gists published since the last run.
